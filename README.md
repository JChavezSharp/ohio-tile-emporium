Just a practice project to start learning the basics of JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

## What did I learn? ðŸ§ 
In this project I learned how to access HTML elements using the `document.getElementByID`.
Accessing elements' children with the `.children` property.
Eliminating elements' children with `.innerHTML`
Using the `text context` to add text to an element
Creating elements with `document.createElement()`.

Also the use of CSS gradients and attribute selectors.
How to keep a footer sticky to the bottom with flexbox (flexbox has a million uses!)
